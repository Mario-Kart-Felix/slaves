	center/range object: The center value is the average or center value of the property, while range is the value range (centered on center). So if center is 1 and range is 0.5, the value can be anything from 0.75 to 1.25.

	== Base ==
	id: The variable ID for identifying the department.
	name: The display name of the department.
	focusDescription: The descriptive phrase of what the department does:
	The department focuses on {breaking slaves}.

	sizeCost: How much a single development of the department costs in thousands.
	maintenance: (object) Defines the amount paid each week.
		linear: How much a single development costs to maintain each week in thousands.
		quadratic: Development maintenance increases quadratically; this is the multiplier on the squared development component.
		category: Which division maintenance category this division belongs to. Multiple divisions in a category increase overhead costs exponentially.
	founding: (object) Defines information regarding the founding of the division.
	corporateCash: Defines how much it costs the player to *found the corporation* with this department with a 2-to-1 split, in thousands. This will be the corporation's starting cash, from which the development and slaves will be purchased.
	startingSize: How developed the department is upon founding, including how many active slaves the department starts with (Note that acquiring divisions don't start with slaves)
	merger: A list of companies that can be purchased during the merger event. The event will collect all of these company objects associated with owned divisions and pick some at random.
		name: The generic name of the company that is being purchased. This will have "the" put in front of it, so it must fit with the sentance "The {name} will be bought."
		cost: How much, in thousands, it will cost to purchase this company. Default: 50.
		text: An object with the flavor text of the event.
			trouble: A description of the company and its troubles. Will be in the sentence "The first company is {trouble}"
			acquire: The text that will be shown when the player chooses to acquire the company. Will be in the sentence "You acquire the {name}{acquire}".
		result: The functional result of acquiring this company.
			development: The number of developments that will be added to this division.
			slaves: the number of activeSlaves that will be added to this division. If the division doesn't have enough room to store them you will have to purchase more development by the end of the week or they will be sold off. *WARNING* Do not provide this property if the division cannot have activeSlave set (Acquiring divisions, for example)

	== Acquiring ==
	An acquiring division generates new slaves. It can always sell to the market but cannot buy from the market.
	slaveValue: How much value is added to a slave when it becomes a Held slave.
	acquiring: (center/range) The percentage of development that can acquire a slave each week.
	mercenaryHelp: (object) If present, defines how and when your mercenaries (not SF) assist this division in acquiring slaves.
	level: What level the mercenaries must be above in order to assist.
	cost: How much each level of mercenary above level costs the department for this assistance, in thousands.
	nextDivision: (list) The ids of the divisions that acquired slaves can be sent directly to. Note that if any of these divisions can send slaves to a listed division, that division will block this division from sending to it. For example, if A->[B,C] and B->C, then A->C can only happen if B *has not* been founded. Once B is founded, slaves from A must proceed A->B->C and cannot skip to C.

	==Processing==
	A processing division enhances the value of slaves. It can always buy from the market and sell to the market.
	addedValue: How much value is added to a slave when it becomes a Held slave.
	processing: (center/range) The percentage of active slaves that become held slaves each week.
	slaveProcessType: (text object) The verb used for the completion of the processing done on slaves. It will be used to explain when a slave moves from processed to held.
	present: The department can {break} 5 slaves.
	past:The department {broke} 5 slaves.
	slaveProcessDescription: The descriptive phrase for what sort of processing is being done to the division's slaves.
	present: the department is {breaking} 5 slaves.
	future: the department will {break} 5 slaves.
	past: Over the past week, the department {broke} 5 slaves.
	market: The department bought {fresh slaves} from the market.
	nextDivision: (list) The ids of the divisions that improved slaves can be sent directly to. Note that if any of these divisions can send slaves to a listed division, that division will block this division from sending to it. For example, if A->[B,C] and B->C, then A->C can only happen if B *has not* been founded. Once B is founded, slaves from A must proceed A->B->C and cannot skip to C.

	==Working==
	A working division produces revenue by working slaves. It can always buy from the market but cannot sell to the market.
	attrition: (center/range) The percentage of active slaves that become no longer workable
	revenue: (center/range) The amount of money generated by a slave.
	slaveProcessDescription: The descriptive phrase for what sort of work is being done by the division's slaves and how they are removed from the workforce.
	present: the department is {exploiting} 5 slaves.
	future: the department will {exploit} 5 slaves.
	past: Over the past week, the department {wore out} 5 slaves.
	market: The department bought {menials} from the market.
