API reference

Introduction
The Tweet is one of the primary resources on Twitter. In its simplest form, a Tweet can contain up to 280 characters and can be posted either publicly or privately, depending on an accountâ€™s settings. However, a variety of different objects can also be attached to Tweet, including media, a place, polls, and URLs. 

While there are a variety of different HTTP, selection, and delivery methods that can deliver, publish, and act upon Tweets, this group of REST endpoints simply returns a Tweet or group of Tweets, specified by a Tweet ID. While simple, these endpoints can be used to receive up-to-date details on a Tweet, verify that a Tweet is available, or update stored details following a compliance event.

These endpoints utilize the GET HTTP method and return one or many Tweet objects, which deliver fields such as the Tweet text, created at date, included URLs and more. 
 

To access these endpoints, you must have an approved developer account. When authenticating, you must use keys and tokens from a developer App that is located within a Project. 

Learn more about getting access to the Twitter API v2 endpoints in our "Getting started" page.
