Query parameters
Name	Type	Description
expansions
 OPTIONAL 	enum (attachments.poll_ids, attachments.media_keys, author_id, entities.mentions.username, geo.place_id, in_reply_to_user_id, referenced_tweets.id, referenced_tweets.id.author_id)	Expansions enable you to request additional data objects that relate to the originally returned Tweets. Submit a list of desired expansions in a comma-separated list without spaces. The ID that represents the expanded data object will be included directly in the Tweet data object, but the expanded object metadata will be returned within the includes response object, and will also include the ID so that you can match this data object to the original Tweet object.

The following data objects can be expanded using this parameter:
The Tweet author's user object
The user object of the Tweet’s author that the original Tweet is responding to
Any mentioned users’ object
Any referenced Tweets’ author’s user object
Attached media’s object
Attached poll’s object
Attached place’s object
Any referenced Tweets’ object
ids
 REQUIRED 	string	A comma separated list of Tweet IDs. Up to 100 are allowed in a single request. Make sure to not include a space between commas and fields.
media.fields
 OPTIONAL 	enum (duration_ms, height, media_key, preview_image_url, type, url, width, public_metrics, non_public_metrics, organic_metrics, promoted_metrics)	This fields parameter enables you to select which specific media fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return media fields if the Tweet contains media and if you've also included the expansions=attachments.media_keys query parameter in your request. While the media ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional media fields in the includes data object.
place.fields
 OPTIONAL 	enum (contained_within, country, country_code, full_name, geo, id, name, place_type)	This fields parameter enables you to select which specific place fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return place fields if the Tweet contains a place and if you've also included the expansions=geo.place_id query parameter in your request. While the place ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional place fields in the includes data object.
poll.fields
 OPTIONAL 	enum (duration_minutes, end_datetime, id, options, voting_status)	This fields parameter enables you to select which specific poll fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. The Tweet will only return poll fields if the Tweet contains a poll and if you've also included the expansions=attachments.poll_ids query parameter in your request. While the poll ID will be located in the Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional poll fields in the includes data object.
tweet.fields
 OPTIONAL 	enum (attachments, author_id, context_annotations, conversation_id, created_at, entities, geo, id, in_reply_to_user_id, lang, non_public_metrics, public_metrics, organic_metrics, promoted_metrics, possibly_sensitive, referenced_tweets, reply_settings, source, text, withheld)	This fields parameter enables you to select which specific Tweet fields will deliver in each returned Tweet object. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. You can also pass the expansions=referenced_tweets.id expansion to return the specified fields for both the original Tweet and any included referenced Tweets. The requested Tweet fields will display in both the original Tweet data object, as well as in the referenced Tweet expanded data object that will be located in the includes data object.
user.fields
 OPTIONAL 	enum (created_at, description, entities, id, location, name, pinned_tweet_id, profile_image_url, protected, public_metrics, url, username, verified, withheld)	This fields parameter enables you to select which specific user fields will deliver in each returned Tweet. Specify the desired fields in a comma-separated list without spaces between commas and fields. While the user ID will be located in the original Tweet object, you will find this ID and all additional user fields in the includes data object.

You must also pass one of the user expansions to return the desired user fields:
expansions=author_id
expansions=entities.mentions.username
expansions=in_reply_to_user_id
expansions=referenced_tweets.id.author_id
