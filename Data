Standard v1.1 compared to Twitter API v2
Comparing Twitter API’s Tweet lookup endpoints
The v2 Tweet lookup endpoints will replace the standard v1.1 GET statuses/lookup and GET statuses/show endpoints, as well as the Labs Tweet lookup endpoints. If you have code, apps, or tools that use one of these versions of the Tweet lookup endpoint, and are considering migrating to the newer Twitter API v2 endpoint, then this set of guides is for you. 

These guides will focus on the following areas:
API request parameters -  The Twitter API v2 endpoint introduces a new set of request parameters. While some parameters will be familiar, especially for those integrating with Labs, there are many important differences such as the introduction of the fields and expansions parameters
New JSON format - Twitter API v2 introduces a completely new JSON format. Any code that parses v1.1 standard, premium, and enterprise JSON payloads will need to be updated to work with the new formats.
App and Project requirements - To access the Twitter API v2, you will need to use credentials from a developer App that is associated with a Project. 

The following tables compare the various types of Twitter Tweet lookup endpoints:
