It’s hard to imagine a world without zero, but it’s actually a surprisingly recent idea. It was discovered way later than numbers like two or 14 or even 3.9 or 64/13. And when you think about it, that’s not surprising – after all, if you’re an ancient Babylonian trying to keep track of your sheep, zero is pretty useless. Even if all your sheep died from some sheep plague, you wouldn’t say “I have zero sheep” like some nerd doing a math test. You’d say something like “pass the opium, Esagil-kin-apli, all my sheep are dead, I’ve no sheep left, it’s been a hell of a day.”
