or use test with the accumulate option, and maybe also with the notest option, to form the
appropriate joint hypothesis:
. test [eq1=eq2], common notest
. test [eq1=eq3], common accumulate notest
. test [eq2=eq3], common accumulate
Constrained coefficients
If the test indicates that the data do not allow you to conclude that the constraints are not satisfied,
you may want to inspect the constrained coefficients. The coef option specified that the constrained
results, estimated by GLS, are shown.
. test [price=weight], common coef
( 1) [price]foreign - [weight]foreign = 0
chi2( 1) = 23.07

The constrained coefficient of foreign is âˆ’216.40 with standard error 74.06 in equations price
and weight. The other coefficients and their standard errors are affected by imposing the equality
constraint of the two coefficients of foreign because the unconstrained estimates of these two
coefficients were correlated with the estimates of the other coefficients.
Technical note
The two-step constrained coefficients bc displayed by test, coef are asymptotically equivalent to
the one-stage constrained estimates that are computed by specifying the constraints during estimation
using the constraint() option of estimation commands (Gourieroux and Monfort 1995, chap. 10).
Generally, one-step constrained estimates have better small-sample properties. For inspection and
interpretation, however, two-step constrained estimates are a convenient alternative. Moreover, some
estimation commands (for example, stcox, many xt estimators) do not have a constraint() option.
