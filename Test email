[Ran into size limitation on the comment]

300 sounds like a reasonable number to start with. Look here: this simulates an experiment with a control (black) and two variants (red and green) I ran this simmulation for 95% significance and 90% strength. The solid lines are the cumulative rate of the test statistic (rate of conversion to the next page in this case), dense dashed lines are the sample sizes, and the sparce dashed lines are the size of the sample that would make the difference observed so far significant, over time. As you see, in the beginning the difference between control and a variant measures varies due to the small sample size, and, accordinly, varies the significant sample size. However, as the measures begin to stabilize, so do the significan sample sizes. At some point, the significant sample sizes cross actual ones and stay under. Thatâ€™s the points of where you can safely call the tests for the chosen levels of significance and strength. The red variant shows greater degradation wrt the control (from 0.1 to ~0.06, i.e. ~40% drop) and consequently its sample size reaches significance at just under 250 trials (the red dot at the intersection of the dotted red lines) . The green variant shows half that much of a drop and requires a much larger sample size of ~1100 (the green dot at the intersection of the dotted green lines). Hope this helps!
